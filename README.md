## CSS Enhancements and Customizations

### Base Styles and Reset

The CSS begins with a comprehensive reset to ensure consistent rendering across browsers:

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

This reset eliminates default browser styling and ensures consistent sizing using the border-box model (MDN Web Docs, 2025).
